```

Check out the ready-to-use <github-link target="ts-npm">example project</github-link> from the `mkdocs` repository.
It includes the essential setup and is a great place to begin.

## 🌐 Use via CDN

Prefer a no-install setup? You can load `mkdocs-ts` directly in the browser using a CDN.

Note that the library doesn't bundle its dependencies—but you can use
[`@w3nest/webpm-client`](https://w3nest.org/apps/@webpm-client/doc/latest) to automatically resolve and load them.
A full working example is available in the repository <github-link target="js-cdn">here</github-link>.

Perfect for demos, sandbox environments, or documentation embedded in static sites.
