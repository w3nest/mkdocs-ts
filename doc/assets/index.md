# @youwol/mkdocs-ts

The `@youwol/mkdocs-ts` library offers a straightforward yet robust solution for creating hierarchical documents.
As demonstrated by this very document, it provides a versatile platform for documentation creation.

In essence, `@youwol/mkdocs-ts` shares similarities with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), but with distinct advantages:

- **Native TypeScript Support:** Unlike MkDocs, `@youwol/mkdocs-ts` is inherently built on TypeScript.
  This enables seamless integration of HTML-rendered views from preferred libraries.
  Leveraging TypeScript also ensures a powerful and secure development environment.

- **Dynamic Nature:** One of its standout features is its dynamic capabilities. The navigation structure of your
  application may not be predetermined and can even evolve during usage.

While TypeScript is a prerequisite for application development, `@youwol/mkdocs-ts` simplifies the process for simple
scenario that can mostly be handled by providing markdown files. In any case, Markdown is a first class citizen of
`@youwol/mkdocs-ts`.
