# Imports

This page is used as example to import javascript symbols from a notebook page into another, the actual import is 
triggered from [the parent page](@nav/tutorials/notebook/import).

<js-cell language='javascript'>
const timer1s = rxjs.timer(0,1000)
</js-cell>

It is also possible to import python functions from python cells, as demonstrated in the
[Python page](@nav/tutorials/notebook/python).
