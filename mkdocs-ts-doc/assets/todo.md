- try remove `basePath` from `Router` constructor class
- attributes `html` & `toc` must get the `data` attribute of associated node
- better handle flexibility in layout rendering
- better handle named parameters in function
- be able to check cross-links
- in custom markdown views, handle how `innerHTML` should be considered (as MD, as HTML, etc)
