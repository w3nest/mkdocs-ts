/**
 * This module offers functionalities akin to a notebook page.
 *
 * The primary entry point is {@link NotebookPage}, which serves as a wrapper for parsing markdown content.
 * The markdown source can contain a series of executable cells, including {@link JsCellView} and {@link MdCellView}.
 * These cells are identified within the markdown source using specific DOM elements (`js-cell`, `md-cell`),
 * and their attributes are passed to the corresponding constructors (refer to {@link JsCellAttributes} and
 * {@link MdCellAttributes} for details).
 *
 * Most of the implementation logic regarding synchronization are included in the {@link State} class.
 *
 * @module Notebook
