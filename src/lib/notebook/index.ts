/**
 * This module offers functionalities akin to a notebook page.
 *
 * The primary entry point is {@link NotebookPage}, which serves as a wrapper for parsing markdown content.
 * The markdown source can contain a series of executable cells, including {@link JsCellView}, {@link MdCellView},
 * {@link PyCellView}, {@link InterpreterCellView} and {@link WorkerCellView}.
 * These cells are identified within the Markdown source using specific DOM elements (`js-cell`, `md-cell`, `py-cell`,
 * `interpreter-cell` and `worker-cell`). Cells feature attributes provided with the DOM element,
 * refer to the associated {@link JsCellAttributes}, {@link MdCellAttributes}, {@link PyCellAttributes},
 * {@link InterpreterCellAttributes} and {@link WorkerCellAttributes}.
 *
 * Most of the implementation logic regarding synchronization are included in the {@link State} class.
 *
